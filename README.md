Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?  
The requirements for this assignment include the development of an android app (via android studio), using java language, for an app that helps the user plan their daily tasks out.  It uses an sqlite database to store, update, read, and delete the tasks, and also handles logging in and out.  

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?  
I think that the most challenging part of the project was the design portion- it was difficult to find exactly what I needed for a given coding challenge- I settled on a list view for the tasks, though only for lack of a better, more fitting option.  The UI is simple for this app, but the options are limited.  The user only needs two "activities", really- the login page, and the tasks view.  Everything else is secondary.  Login, CRUD your tasks, and that's all.  

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?  
The UI dictates the code in this case, unlike how I'm used to developing things.  With these android applications, you need to set up the UI, then work to implement the features relating to your UI.  It sort of simplifies the process for me, personally, where in you begin to piece together the code before you've written it.  It makes you plan ahead.  

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?  
I hooked up my phone, and tested every possible outcome / combination.  I had a ticklist to go through.  It's obviously important because if it doesn't end up with everything checked off and successful, then your code isn't working.  

Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?  
In the (as of submission time) unfinished notifications implementation, I never would have expected to need to do so much leg work to display a notification on a phone.  It seems like such a common thing, but at least with my phone, in order to get it working, I had to go through countless little loopholes and workarounds to try to get permissions to send the notification.  I eventually did but it felt like such a hack that I deleted it from my submission, with the itnention of going back to fix it later.  

In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?  
I think that the flow of the program is perfect- there are no loose ends, or possible interactions that are unaccounted for; this program works exactly as intended.  No bugs or anything of the sort like that.
